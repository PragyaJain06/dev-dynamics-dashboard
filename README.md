# dev-dynamics-dashboard

In this project, I have created a simple yet interactive Dashboard.
There are 2 dropdowns, to select the user and to select the date.
On selecting all the users, the graphs will be shown for total activitites done by the user.
On selecting all the users and the date, the graphs will depict the total activities by all the users in that particular date.
On selecting the user and the date, the day wise activities of the user will be shown through the graphs.
I have created cards to display the values and all the values are coming dynamically.
